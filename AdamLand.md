# Adamland: An Immersive Project Management System

Welcome to Adamland, a rich, engaging project management system designed to help you organize, develop, and synthesize your ideas and goals. Inspired by the structure and spirit of a medieval kingdom, Adamland transforms your projects and tasks into a vibrant, interconnected landscape of villages, each with its own unique purpose and character.

Beneath its fun facade, AdamLand is a project management app designed for solopreneurs and generalists. It provides a holistic approach to managing various aspects of life and work through a simple, intuitive interface.

## Overview

AdamLand organizes your life and projects into four main categories, called "Villages":

1. **Internal**: For personal development projects (e.g., health plans, philosophical explorations, habit formation)
2. **Home**: For daily life management (e.g., budgeting, taxes, home repairs, vehicle maintenance)
3. **Family**: For relationship-related projects and goals
4. **External**: For projects to be shared with society (e.g., woodworking, art, writing, business ideas)

Each Village contains multiple Buildings, and each Building can have multiple Projects, Goals, checklists, text areas, and URLs.

## Features

- Four pre-defined Villages
- Create and manage multiple Buildings and Projects within each Village
- Add Goals to Projects with optional deadlines
- Integrate with Google Calendar or iCal for deadline tracking
- Unique and fun user interface, reminiscent of olde english leatherbound books and scrolls
- Checklist functionality for tracking tasks within Projects
- Text areas for additional notes and information
- URL storage for relevant links and resources
- Input screen with minimalist design for capturing new ideas and tasks on the go. These are displayed on the Home screen in King's Messenger.

## The King's Castle

At the heart of AdamLand lies the King's Castle, the central hub where ideas from all the villages come together to mingle, interact, and create new possibilities.

- **Royal Messenger**: This is where new ideas and projects are initially collected, like a grand "idea inbox". From here, you can assign them to the appropriate village (by dragging them in) or let them simmer until the time is right.
   
- **Synthesis Forge**: An automated AI task that runs periodically (e.g., every few days) to analyze the ideas and projects from all the villages and generate new, synthesized concepts. The output is delivered to the Marketplace of Ideas for further exploration and development.
   
- **Map Room**: Provides a high-level overview of your entire project landscape, allowing you to track progress, spot connections, and make strategic decisions. It's like a living, interactive map of your personal and professional journey.
